I have always been fascinated by segment trees. But as someone who craves to find real world applications of every tiny piece of knowledge I find, I didn’t appreciate the optimizations that it actually makes.

Okay but what the heck is a segment tree and actually what the heck is a Lightning network?

Well, a comprehensive look at both of these things would require two separate articles, hence I present here a brief first principles approach for both of these:

## Segment trees 
*(If you already know this then please skip to the next section…trust me I’m not that smart to tell you something new)*

Segment trees are data structures that are most potently used for Range queries. Suppose you want to find for a lot of queries the value of some operation done over a range of data in a data structure(most commonly arrays).

Now if one wants to do that naively, you can just do that range operation for each element in the structure for each query. Now, if that seems like a non-optimal way, it is. Instead we come up with a beautiful way to sort of group mini queries together such that those mini queries have a kind of precomputed answer that we can utilize to more quickly calculate the main query.

So suppose you have an array that consists of values that you want to find range sums for (lets say you are given queries like find the sum from index 2 to 5, 4 to 6, 1 to 4 etc). You can consider each element to be kind of like a leaf node, and then compute (as you go up the tree), pairwise sums (so the next level would have nodes which represent the sum of 1 and 2, 3 and 4, and so on), then the level above would have pairwise sums of these (like sum of (el1+el2) and (el3+el4)).

Now for each query, instead of going to the deepest level and computing the sum element by element, we can just stop at a level which is completely inside our queries (so for query 1–4, since 1–2 and 3–4 are completely inside our range, we can just directly use their sum, instead of going down the level and adding arr[3] and arr[4] to the answer). The crucial observation is that there is at max 2 nodes at each level that are selected to compute the answer for a particular query (you can check by taking some random examples). This means that at max we would be needing 2*(No. of Levels) nodes to compute the answer. This is the main observation that we are also going to be using in lightning networks.

The main optimization comes when we need to change some values in the array. For that, we would need to update the array, and then calculate the sum for that query(if we use the naive approach), which is O(N) for a particular query (too expensive). So instead, we could utilize another property of segment trees (or trees in general), that binary trees have a height of log(N), where N is the number of nodes.

How does that help? Well for a query that requires you to update a number, you can change that index, and then propagate that change to its parent, and then to its parent (siblings don’t matter). That way, since direct route from the child to the parent is of log(N) length, you only need to do log(N) changes. And since we would need 2*(No. of. Levels) = 2*Log(N) to actually compute the answer, we can do the whole operation is O(log(N)) complexity. Great Success!

## Lightning Networks

The lightning network is a protocol built on top of blockchain. It solves the problem traditional blockchain faces which is the verification of transactions taking too long.

Avoiding going into too much detail, lightning network uses HTLCs or Hashed Time Locked Contracts. These are contracts/transactions that can be spent after a specific amount of time by the party that broadcasts it (hence time-locked).

The essence of it is opening and closing of channels. So if party A wants to pay party B, they will agree to open a channel so that they can have transactions that can fund either of the parties. Now suppose there is a transaction by party A that gives party A 1 BTC (from its own wallet) and transfers 9 BTC to party B. In the lightning network if such a transaction is sent to party B after signing, then it is considered pretty much a valid transaction, that requires no on chain verification (skipping a lot of details here). Essentially, now if party B wants to pay party A (lets say 4 BTC), they’ll have to revoke the previous transaction. Why? Well in a channel, if you settle a transaction, then the channel is closed. So if for example after sending 4 BTC to A, all of a sudden B decides to settle the transaction at the first state (to his benefit), it is a loss for A. To prevent that, both parties mutually agree on revealing a “Revocation key” for state N that prevents them from broadcasting a previous state (that might be more beneficial for them). How exactly?

*Deleting and Adding states (source: [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mas-s62-cryptocurrency-engineering-and-design-spring-2018/resources/lec13-payment-channels-and-lightning-network/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mas-s62-cryptocurrency-engineering-and-design-spring-2018/resources/lec13-payment-channels-and-lightning-network/))*

As earlier said, broadcasting a transaction takes some fixed time to go through, and it is this design choice that allows the other party to use the data available in the broadcasted transaction + the revocation key provided by the other party to essentially provide enough data to keep all the funds to themselves! That is the a clever design choice that allows each party to hold their horses…basically.

Wait wasn’t this about segment trees also? Okay so remember I told you A and B need to mutually give each other their revocation key…well how do you optimize their storage? Suppose you have got N revocation keys for N states, and A just betrayed you and broadcasted the 1st state. You need to store all the N revocation keys (O(N) in space complexity) and search on them in log(N) time or you can store a chain of hashes (kind of like blockchain itself) to store only the final key, and kind of hash it continuously N number of times, which is O(N) in time complexity.

The solution? We utilize the unique property of segment trees, and how a node can store the data of its children.

So the sender has this root which is a random string of characters. And from it going left they append 0 to it and hash it to get the left child, and append 1 to it and hash to to get the right child.

Assuming we are the receiver, we don’t know anything yet. So if we get revocation key 1 and 2, we store them as leaf nodes. But if we get the key 3, then we can say: well as per the data structure that we are considering, 3 should be the parent of 1 and 2, so we only store 3. And if we want to get the value of keys 1 and 2, we can just append 0 and 1 respectively and hash to get them.

This makes use of a property that I discussed earlier as well of there being no more than 2 nodes that are required at each level. That holds here as well! So we have optimized our storage to log(N), and since to search a particular key we need to go at max from the root to the leaf, we have optimized the search to log(N) as well. Log(N) space and Log(N) time complexity, much better than the previous case.

This method is coined Elkrem by Tadge Dryja, a sort of play of words of Merkle (the reverse of Merkle root algorithm, if you know about that from traditional blockchain).

Thus we conclude with an optimized method of storing revocation keys in Hashed Time Locked Contracts in Lightning Network, if you ever want to flex that piece of knowledge in front of peeps. Not that it is useless, I mean it is at least better than millions who know about segment trees without seeing their actual application.

If you have come this far, thank you for reading this and please let me know if you want some clarifications regarding this (not me asking for more medium article ideas 😅)
